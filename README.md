# FrontEndChallenge Shopify
We are expanding Shopify's business to the universe and fetching photos from outer space thanks to NASA's amazing Astronomy Picture Of the Day API. This app allows users to browse photos starting from a specific date. It provides context of each image, with a title and date captured and a button to “like” that image.
